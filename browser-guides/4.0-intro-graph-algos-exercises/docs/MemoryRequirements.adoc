== Memory Requirements (Preparations)

The database you start with must contain all of the data you loaded in the setup for this course.
After having completed all exercises prior to this one you will see:

At a minimum, if you do not see the European Roads and Game of Thrones data in your Neo4j Browser, you will need to perform the setup  and *Load Data* steps.

== Memory Requirements (Graph Catalog)

The projected graphs *roads* and *dach-region* must be created and stored in the GDS graph catalog.

This is what you will see when you execute the following query if you have completed all previous exercises:

[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.graph.list()
YIELD graphName, nodeCount, relationshipCount
----

For this exercise, you must have the *roads* and *dach-region* graphs created. If not, you will need to perform the *Graph Catalog* steps.

== Memory Requirements (Overview)

Before you run a graph algorithm, it is helpful to understand what the memory requirements will be for loading the data for the analysis, as well as the memory that will be required to run the algorithm. The `estimate()` function is used to provide you with this information and is available for the production-quality tier algorithms.

In this exercise, you will determine the memory requirements for each algorithm on the datasets you have been working with:

* *Part 1*: Determine the memory requirements for loading named graphs.
* *Part 2*: Determine the memory requirements for running algorithms on these graphs.

Go to the next page to start this exercise.

== Part 1: Determine the memory requirements for loading named graphs. (Instructions)

Write the Cypher code to determine the memory requirements for loading these graphs:

* Game of Thrones dataset using the *Character* nodes and the *INTERACTS_SEASON1* relationships.
* Game of Thrones dataset using the *Character* nodes and the *INTERACTS_SEASON1* relationships with included relationship weight property.
* European roads dataset using the *Place* nodes and the *EROADS* relationships with included relationship weight property.


== Part 1: Determine the memory requirements for loading named graphs. (Solution)

Write the Cypher code to determine the memory requirements for loading these graphs:

* Game of Thrones dataset using the *Character* nodes and the *INTERACTS_SEASON1* relationships.

Here is the solution code:

[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.graph.create.estimate('Character', 'INTERACTS_SEASON1')
YIELD requiredMemory
----

This load requires 299 KiB of memory.

* Game of Thrones dataset using the *Character* nodes and the *INTERACTS_SEASON1* relationships with included *weight* relationship property.

Here is the solution code:

[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.graph.create.estimate('Character', 'INTERACTS_SEASON1', 
    {relationshipProperties:'weight'})
YIELD requiredMemory
----

This load requires 563 KiB of memory.

* European roads dataset using the *Place* nodes and the *EROADS* relationships with included *inverse_distance* relationship property.

Here is the solution code:

[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.graph.create.estimate('Place', 'EROAD', 
    {relationshipProperties:'inverse_distance'})
YIELD requiredMemory
----

This load requires 567 KiB of memory.

== Part 2: Determine the memory requirements for running algorithms on these graphs. (Instructions)

Write the Cypher code to determine the memory requirements for running these algorithms on these graphs:

* PageRank on the European roads dataset.
* Betweenness centrality on the DACH region of the European roads dataset.
* Weakly Connected Components on the Game of Thrones dataset using the *Character* nodes and the *INTERACTS_SEASON1* relationships.
* Louvain Modularity on the Game of Thrones dataset using the *Character* nodes and the *INTERACTS_SEASON5* relationships.

== Part 2: Determine the memory requirements for running algorithms on these graphs. (Solution)

Write the Cypher code to determine the memory requirements for running these algorithms on these graphs:

* PageRank on the European roads dataset.

Here is the solution code:

[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.pageRank.stream.estimate('roads')
YIELD requiredMemory
----

This algorithm requires 29 KiB of memory.

* Betweenness centrality on the DACH region of the European roads dataset.

Here is the solution code:

[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.betweenness.stream.estimate('dach-region')
YIELD requiredMemory
----

This algorithm requires 37 KiB of memory.

* Weakly Connected Components on the Game of Thrones dataset using the *Character* nodes and the *INTERACTS_SEASON1* relationships.

Here is the solution code:

[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.wcc.write.estimate({nodeProjection:'Character', 
                             relationshipProjection:'INTERACTS_SEASON1',
                             writeProperty:'wcc'})
YIELD requiredMemory
----

This algorithm requires 302 KiB of memory.

* Louvain Modularity on the Game of Thrones dataset using the *Character* nodes and the *INTERACTS_SEASON5* relationships.

Here is the solution code:

[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.louvain.stream.estimate({
    nodeProjection:'Character', 
    relationshipProjection:'INTERACTS_SEASON5'})
YIELD requiredMemory
----

This algorithm requires 329 KiB to 951 KiB of memory.

Note that when you estimate the memory requirements of an anonymous graph projection, the memory requirements for both the graph projection and algorithm execution will be estimated.
However, when you estimate the memory requirements for a graph algorithm on a named graph projections, only the memory requirements for algorithm execution will be estimated.

== Memory Requirements: Taking it further

Calculate memory requirements for different combinations of graphs and algorithms.

== Memory Requirements (Summary)

In this exercise, you gained some experience estimating the memory requirements for loading graphs into memory and executing some production-tier algorithms.
