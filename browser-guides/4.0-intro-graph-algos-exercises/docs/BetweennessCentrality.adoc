== Betweenness Centrality (Preparations)

The database you start with must contain all of the data you loaded in the setup for this course.

This is what you will see when you click the database icon image:database-icon.png[].

If you do not see this in your Neo4j Browser, you will need to perform the setup  and *Load Data* steps.

== Betweenness Centrality (Graph Catalog)

The projected graphs *roads* and *dach-region* must be created and stored in the GDS graph catalog.

This is what you will see when you execute the following query:

[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.graph.list()
YIELD graphName, nodeCount, relationshipCount
----

If you do not see this in your Neo4j Browser, you will need to perform the *Graph Catalog* steps.

== Betweenness Centrality (Overview)

The Betweenness centrality algorithm detects the amount of influence a node has over the flow of information in a graph.
It is often used to find nodes that serve as a bridge from one part of a graph to another.

The algorithm calculates the shortest path between all pairs of nodes in the graph, and the nodes that most frequently occur on these paths will have the highest score.

In this exercise, you will execute betweenness centrality algorithm on the European Roads dataset:

* *Part 1*: Perform Betweenness Centrality analysis.
* *Part 1*: Perform Betweenness Centrality analysis on the DACH region of the network.
* *Part 2*: Perform a variation of Betweenness Centrality analysis: Randomized-Approximate Brandes.

Go to the next page to start this exercise.

== Part 1: Perform Betweenness Centrality analysis. (Instructions)

You will use the Betweenness Centrality algorithm to find the bridge nodes in the European Roads network.
Places that most frequently lie on the shortest paths between other network places will rank the highest.

Write the Cypher code to perform the stream variation of the Betweenness Centrality algorithm. It will return nodeId and score value.

* The algorithm must use the projected graph *roads*, which is stored in the graph catalog.
* Use the `stream` mode of the Betweenness Centrality algorithm.
* Use the `gds.util.asNode()` function to fetch the node from the nodeId value and return its name.
* Order the results by betweenness centrality score descending.
* Limit it to the top ten results.

*Hint*: Call `gds.betweenness.stream` with no other special configuration values.

== Part 1: Perform Betweenness Centrality analysis. (Solution)

Write the Cypher code to perform the stream variation of the Betweenness Centrality algorithm. It will return nodeId and score value.

* The algorithm must use the projected graph *roads*, which is stored in the graph catalog.
* Use the `stream` mode of the Betweenness Centrality algorithm.
* Use the `gds.util.asNode()` function to fetch the node from the nodeId value and return its name.
* Order the results by betweenness centrality score descending.
* Limit it to the top ten results.


*Hint*: Call `gds.betweenness.stream` with no other special configuration values.

Here is the solution code:

[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.betweenness.stream('roads')
YIELD nodeId, score
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS place, score
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 10
----

The results returned will look like this:

Berlin is quite influential by both the PageRank and Betweenness centrality scores.
The most influential bridge in the network is Wien, followed by Paris.
The city of Wien lies at the intersection of Western and Eastern Europe, so that might be why it has a high betweenness score.
If you plan any long road trips across Europe, you will most likely pass through Wien and should grab yourself a Wiener Schnitzel.

== Part 2: Perform Betweenness Centrality analysis on the DACH region of the network (Instructions)

Next, you will use the Betweenness Centrality algorithm to find the bridge places in the DACH subregion.
Wien is in Austria, which is part of the DACH region. 
It might be interesting to see if it will still hold a high betweenness rank when considering road trips only between Germany, Austria, and Switzerland.

Write the Cypher code to perform the stream variation of the Betweenness Centrality algorithm. It will return nodeId and score value.

* The algorithm must use the projected graph *dach-region*, which is stored in the graph catalog.
* Use the `gds.util.asNode()` function to fetch the node from the nodeId value and return its name.
* Order the results by betweenness centrality score descending.
* Limit it to the top ten results.


*Hint*: Call `gds.betweenness.stream` with no other special configuration values.

----
CALL gds.betweenness.stream('dach-region')
YIELD nodeId, score
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS place, score
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 10
----

The results returned will look like this:

Wien does not show up in the places with the highest betweenness rank of the DACH subregion.
While it connects Western and Eastern Europe, it lies on the DACH region's outskirts, which explains the low betweenness rank of the DACH region.
The most influential bridges in the DACH area are München and Nürnberg.

== Part 3: Perform a variation of Betweenness Centrality analysis: Randomized-Approximate Brandes. (Instructions)

On very large graphs it is not really feasible to run all these shortest path computations, so you might choose to use an approximate version of the algorithm.

Write the Cypher code to perform the Randomized-Approximate variation of the Betweenness Centrality algorithm.
It will return nodeId and score value.

* The algorithm must use the projected graph *roads*, which is stored in the graph catalog.
* Add the *samplingSize* parameter.
* Specify the sampling size of 100.
* Use the `gds.util.asNode()` function to fetch the node from the nodeId value and return its name.
* Limit it to the top ten results.


*Hint*: Call `gds.betweenness.stream`

== Part 3: Perform a variation of Betweenness Centrality analysis: Randomized-Approximate Brandes. (Solution)

Write the Cypher code to perform the Randomized-Approximate variation of the Betweenness Centrality algorithm.
It will return nodeId and score value.

* The algorithm must use the projected graph *roads*, which is stored in the graph catalog.
* Add the *samplingSize* parameter.
* Specify the sampling size of 100.
* Use the `gds.util.asNode()` function to fetch the node from the nodeId value and return its name.
* Limit it to the top ten results.


*Hint*: Call `gds.betweenness.stream`

The following query runs the RA-Brandes algorithm which calculates betweenness based on sampling parts of the graph:
[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.betweenness.stream('roads', {
    samplingSize:100})
YIELD nodeId, score
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS place, score
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 10
----

You will see similar results as with the original algorithm. Due to randomness, each result will be slightly different.
Try running this algorithm with different sampling size values to examine how it influences the results.

== Betweenness Centrality: Taking it further

Try the Randomized-Approximate Brandes analysis with different values for:

* samplingSize
* samplingSeed

== Betweenness Centrality (Summary)

Betweenness centrality is one of the centrality measures to help you identify important nodes in the graph.
