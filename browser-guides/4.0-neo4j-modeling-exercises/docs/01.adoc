== Exercise 1: Getting started with the airport graph data model (Preparations)

You will now work with the airport graph data model.

You must start with an empty database.

Throughout these exercises, you will be comparing query profiling results before and after refactoring.
Since you may want to view query results that you performed throughout these exercises, you must set your Neo4j Browser to cache up to at least 100 result frames with a history of at least 100.

== Exercise 1: Getting started with the airport graph data model (Overview)

You will be working with data related to flights and airports.
In this exercise, you will create nodes and relationships that reflect our very simple  model that has an airport entity.

Here are the tasks for this exercise:

* *Exercise 1.1*: Implement the starting model containing `Airport` nodes.
* *Exercise 1.2*: Display the nodes and relationships in the graph.
* *Exercise 1.3*: Query the graph.

== Exercise 1.1: Implement the starting model containing `Airport` nodes (Instructions)

Here is the starting airport model with sample data:

*Write and execute the Cypher code to create the nodes and relationships for this simple airport model with sample data.*

== Exercise 1.1: Implement the starting model containing `Airport` nodes  (Solution)

Here is the starting airport model:

*Write and execute the Cypher code to create the nodes and relationships for this simple airport model.*

[source, cypher]
----
MERGE (a1:Airport {code: 'LAS'})
MERGE (a2:Airport {code:'LAX'})
MERGE (a3:Airport {code:'ABQ'})
MERGE (a1)-[:CONNECTED_TO {airline:'WN',flightNumber:'82',date:'2019-1-3',departure:'1715',arrival:'1820'}]->(a2)
MERGE (a1)-[:CONNECTED_TO {airline:'WN',flightNumber:'500',date:'2019-1-3',departure:'1445',arrival:'1710'}]->(a3)
----

The result returned will be:

== Exercise 1.2: Display the newly-created nodes (Instructions)

*Write and execute a Cypher query to return all nodes in the graph.*

== Exercise 1.2: Display the newly-created nodes (Solution)

*Write and execute a Cypher query to return all nodes in the graph.*

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (n)
RETURN n
----

The result returned will be:

== Exercise 1.3: Query the graph (Instructions)

*Write and execute a Cypher query to return all connections leaving LAS.*

== Exercise 1.3: Query the graph (Solution)

*Write and execute a Cypher query to return all connections leaving LAS.*

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH connection = (:Airport {code: 'LAS'})-[:CONNECTED_TO]->(:Airport)
RETURN connection
----

The result returned will be:

== Exercise 1: Getting started with the airport graph data model (Summary)

In this exercise, you created the initial graph for the airport graph data model that you will be working with.
This graph is just a start. In the next exercise you will load more data into the graph.
