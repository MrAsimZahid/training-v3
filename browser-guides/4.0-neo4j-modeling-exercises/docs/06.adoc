== Exercise 6: Creating specific relationships  (Preparations)

Before you begin this exercise, make sure that you have performed the refactoring from Exercise 5.

This is what you will see when you click the database icon image:database-icon.png[].

*If your database does not have the same nodes and relationships, you can execute these Cypher statements to reset your graph to what it must be before you start this exercise.*

*Note*: To execute this Cypher code, you [.underline]#must# have the APOC library installed for your database.

== Exercise 6: Creating specific relationships (Overview)

Neo4j is optimized for searching by unique relationship types and in this case the date of a flight provides that uniqueness.

You will refactor the model to change the `HAS_DAY` relationship to be the date of the flight instead, for example `ON_2019-1-3`.

Here are the tasks you will perform:

* *Exercise 6.1*: Refactor the graph to change all `HAS_DAY` relationships to specific day relationships.
* *Exercise 6.2*: Rewrite and profile the previous query that finds all flights from an airport to another on a given day.

Go to the next page to start this exercise.

== Exercise 6.1:  Refactor the graph to change all `HAS_DAY` relationships to specific day relationships. (Instructions)

Rather than having the `HAS_DAY` relationship from `Airport` nodes to `AirportDay` nodes, we want a specific relationship that will be `ON_yyyy-mm-dd`.
The revised model is:

*Write and execute the Cypher statement to refactor the model.*

*Hint*: Use apoc.create.relationship().

== Exercise 6.2:  Rewrite and profile the previous query that finds all flights from an airport to another on a given day. (Instructions)

Previously, we used this query to look for all flights that go from Las Vegas (LAS) to Chicago (MDW) on January 3, 2019 (2019-1-3).

[source,Cypher]
----
PROFILE MATCH (origin:Airport {code: 'LAS'})-[:HAS_DAY]->(:AirportDay
      {date: '2019-1-3'})<-[:ORIGINATES_FROM]-(flight:Flight),
      (flight)-[:LANDS_IN]->(:AirportDay
      {date: '2019-1-3'})<-[:HAS_DAY]-(destination:Airport {code: 'MDW'})
RETURN origin, destination, flight
----

*Modify this query to use the refactored graph and execute the query.*

The previous query before this refactoring yielded 4271 db hits.
After this refactoring and rewriting the query, we see 5829 db hits which is worse.
If the graph had more data for more days' worth of data, we would see a difference in the performance after the last refactoring.

== Exercise 6: Creating specific relationships  (Taking it further)

Execute these previous two queries to see if the refactoring to specific relationships changed their performance:

Previously, this query showed 199 db hits:

[source,Cypher]
----
PROFILE
MATCH (origin)<-[:ORIGINATES_FROM]-(flight:Flight)-
      [:LANDS_IN]->(destination)
WHERE flight.airline = 'WN' AND
      flight.number = '1016' RETURN origin, destination, flight
----

Previously, this query showed 704 db hits:

[source,Cypher]
----
PROFILE
MATCH (f:Flight)
WHERE f.flightId ENDS WITH 'LAS'
RETURN f.flightId
----

== Exercise 6: Creating specific relationships  (Summary)

In this exercise, you refactored the `HAS_DAY` relationship between the `Airport` and the `AirportDay` to be a specific date relationship.
For the existing graph with 10K flight nodes, this change did not make a significant difference.
If the graph had more data (more data for more days), we would probably see an improvement.

In the next exercise, you will load even more data in to the graph.
