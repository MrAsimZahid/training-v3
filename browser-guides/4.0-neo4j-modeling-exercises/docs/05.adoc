== Exercise 5: Creating the `AirportDay` node from the `Airport` and `Flight` nodes  (Preparations)

Before you begin this exercise, make sure that you have performed the refactoring from Exercise 4.

This is what you will see when you click the database icon image:database-icon.png[].

*If your database does not have the same nodes and relationships, you can execute these Cypher statements to reset your graph to what it must be before you start this exercise.*

*Note*: To execute this Cypher code, you [.underline]#must# have the APOC library installed for your database.

== Exercise 5: Creating the `AirportDay` node from the `Airport` and `Flight` nodes (Overview)

Although we have refactored our graph to make two queries perform better, we have yet another query that our model needs to support.
The new query is one where a user is trying to find flights from one airport to another on a particular day.
In this exercise, you will first add more data to the graph and then profile a new query to see that the query is not performing well.
Then you will refactor the graph to implement a new model and profile again.

Here are the tasks you will perform:

* *Exercise 5.1*: Add more data to the graph.
* *Exercise 5.2*: Profile the new query that finds all flights from airport to another on a given day.
* *Exercise 5.3*: Add a unique constraint on the `airportDayId` property of the `AirportDay` node.
* *Exercise 5.4*: Refactor the graph to create `AirportDay` nodes from `Flight` nodes and `Airport` nodes.
* *Exercise 5.5*: Profile our first query that finds all flights that land in Las Vegas.
* *Exercise 5.6*: Profile our second query that finds all flights for airline 'WN' with flight number '1016'.
* *Exercise 5.7*: Profile the new query that finds all flights from airport to another on a given day.

== Exercise 5.2:  Profile the new query that finds all flights from airport to another on a given day. (Instructions)

Suppose you are looking for all flights that go from Las Vegas (LAS) to Chicago (MDW) on January 3, 2019 (2019-1-3).

*Using the current model in the graph, write and execute the query to find those flights.*

Here we see 4959 db hits.
We have increased the number of flights in the database tenfold, but we might be able to do better.
We will give it a try and create the `AirportDay` node where each `Airport` will be connected by a `HAS_DAY` relationship to an `AirportDay` node for each day.

== Exercise 5.3:  Add a unique constraint on the `AirportDay.airportDayId` property.  (Instructions)

*Write and execute the Cypher statement to add a unique constraint to the `AirportDay` nodes based upon the `airportDayId` property.*

== Exercise 5.3:  Add a unique constraint on the `AirportDay.airportDayId` property. (Solution)

CREATE CONSTRAINT AirportDay_airportDayId_constraint ON (a:AirportDay)
ASSERT a.airportDayId IS UNIQUE;

== Exercise 5.4:  Refactor the graph to create `AirportDay` nodes from `Flight` nodes and `Airport nodes`. (Instructions)

`AirportDay` nodes will be created from existing `Flight` nodes and their relationships with `Airports`.
Each `Airport` node will have the `HAS_DAY` relationship with an `AirportDay` node which represents a particular day.

The properties for the `AirportDay` nodes will be set as follows:

* `airportDayId`: origin.code + '_' + flight.date or destination.code '_' + flight.date , depending on whether the relationship is an `ORIGINATES_FROM` or `LANDS_IN` relationship.
* `date`: flight.date

Here is the model  you will refactor to:

*Write and execute the Cypher statement to go through all `Flights` and how they are connected to `Airports` to create the `AirportDay` nodes.*

== Exercise 5.5:  Profile our first query that finds all flights that land in Las Vegas. (Instructions)

*Execute this query again with the refactored graph*:

PROFILE
MATCH (f:Flight)
WHERE f.flightId ENDS WITH 'LAS'
RETURN f.flightId

This same query with the previous model had 49 db hits.
This query now has 704 db hits, but we have increased the number of flights by a factor of 10 so this result is expected.

== Exercise 5.6:  Profile our second query that finds all flights for airline 'WN' with flight number '1016'. (Instructions)

*Execute this query again with the refactored graph*:

[source,Cypher]
----
PROFILE
MATCH (origin)<-[:ORIGINATES_FROM]-(flight:Flight)-
      [:LANDS_IN]->(destination)
WHERE flight.airline = 'WN' AND
      flight.number = '1016' RETURN origin, destination, flight

The result returned will be:

image::Ex5_Profile2.png[Ex5_Profile2,width=200]

This query with the previous model had 40 db hits.
This query now has 199 db hits, but we have increased the number of flights by a factor of 10 so this result is expected.

== Exercise 5.7:  Profile the new query that finds all flights from airport to another on a given day. (Instructions)

Our original query to find  all flights that fly from Las Vegas (LAS) to Chicago (MDW) on January 3, 2019 (2019-1-3) was:

[source,Cypher]
----
PROFILE MATCH (origin:Airport {code: 'LAS'})
    <-[:ORIGINATES_FROM]-(flight:Flight)-[:LANDS_IN]->
    (destination:Airport {code: 'MDW'})
WHERE flight.date = '2019-1-3'
RETURN origin, destination, flight
----

*Use the refactored model to rewrite this query and execute it against the graph.*

image::Ex5_FindFlightsJan3New.png[Ex5_FindFlightsJan3New,width=200]

The previous query before the refactoring yielded 4959 db hits.
After the refactoring and rewriting the query, we see 3968 db hits which is an improvement.

== Exercise 5: Creating the `AirportDay` node from the `Airport` and `Flight` nodes  (Summary)

In this exercise, you refactored the nodes and relationships in the graph for a  model and implementation that performs better.
You created the `AirportDay` node from `Flight` and `Airport` nodes so that a date-specfic query will perform better.
Then, you profiled queries to confirm that they perform better with the refactored graph.
