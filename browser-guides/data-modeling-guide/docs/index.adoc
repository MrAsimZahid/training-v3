Welcome to this _Browser Guide_!

This is the interface for learning about Graph Data Modeling for Neo4j.

Navigate through the Guide by pressing the forward button at the right of the window.

We start by walking you through some preparations and instructions.
If you have used Neo4j Browser Guides before, you can skip to the last page.

== Before you start

=== Enable multi-statement query editor

. Click the Browser Settings button in the lower left side of Neo4j Browser image:browser-settings-button.png[].
. Make sure that the _Enable multi statement query editor_ checkbox is selected: image:enable-multi-statement-query-editor.png[]

=== Pin a window

It is useful to pin the Browser Guide to the top, so that it doesn't scroll down when you execute statements.
You do this by pressing the _pin_ button in the upper right corner of the page: image:pin-button.png[]
Pressing it once more will _unpin_ the window again: image:unpin-button.png[]. 

== Writing and executing queries

. Write the query in the query pane at the top of Neo4j Browser.
. Click the _Run_ button image:run-button.png[width=25] in order to execute the code.

=== Using code blocks

Many of the steps contain _code blocks_ with runnable code.
Follow these steps in order to run the code in your database:

. Click inside of the code block.
You will notice that the code is copied into the code pane at the top of Neo4j Browser.
. Click the _Run_ button image:run-button.png[width=25] in order to execute the code.

== Starting with a fresh database

If you choose to run the Cypher code at the end of this guide, it will be helpful if your database is empty.

Execute this code to clear the database (Neo4j 4.x required; here database name is *neo4j*):

[source, cypher]
----
CREATE OR REPLACE DATABASE neo4j;
----

You should now have no nodes or relationships in the database:
