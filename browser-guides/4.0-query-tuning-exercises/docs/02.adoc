== Exercise 2: Prepare for Query Tuning (Preparations)

Before you begin this exercise, you must have completed the setup instructions in the previous exercise.
That is, you must  have a database that has access to the APOC library.

If you have not populated the database yet, execute this Cypher code to populate the database:

[source,Cypher]
----
include::scripts/initialDatabase.cypher[]
----

This is what you will see in the left panel for the database:

You are now ready to start this exercise.

== Exercise 2: Prepare for Query Tuning (Overview)

In this exercise, you will gain some experience with the things you would do to prepare for query tuning.

* *Exercise 2.1*: Determine the size of the graph.
* *Exercise 2.2*: View some Neo4j configuration settings for memory.
* *Exercise 2.3*: Inspect a query for expected behavior.
* *Exercise 2.4*: Inspect another query for expected behavior.
* *Exercise 2.5*: Warm up the Page Cache.
* *Exercise 2.6*: View the Page Cache information.

Go to the next page to start this exercise.

== Exercise 2.1: Determine the size of the graph (Instructions)

In Neo4j Browser, write and execute the command to view information the graph. In particular, how large it is.

== Exercise 2.1: Determine the size of the graph (Solution)

In Neo4j Browser, write and execute the command to view information the graph. In particular, how large it is.

You will see something like this when you enter the `:sysinfo` command:

The default database, neo4j is ~38 Mb.

== Exercise 2.2: View some Neo4j configuration settings for memory (Instructions)

The database we use for this course is relatively small so we can safely utilize the default settings.
That is, you need not modify any of the configuration settings for memory and can use defaults.
For your real application graph, you may need to adjust them.

Write and execute the Cypher statement to show the values for the dbms memory-related properties.

== Exercise 2.2: View and some Neo4j configuration settings for memory (Solution)

The database we use for this course is relatively small so we can safely utilize the default settings.
That is, you need not modify any of the configuration settings for memory and can use defaults.
For your real application graph, you may need to adjust them.

Write and execute the Cypher statement to show the values for the dbms memory-related properties.

[source, cypher]
----
CALL dbms.listConfig() YIELD name, value
WHERE name STARTS WITH 'dbms.memory'
RETURN name, value
----

The result returned will be:

In your real application environment, you can modify these values in the *neo4j.conf* file.
You must restart the Neo4j instance for them to be in effect.

== Exercise 2.3: Inspect a query for expected behavior (Instructions)

Here is a query that you may be tuning. Check it out to make sure that it will perform correctly using the `EXPLAIN` clause:

*Hint*: You may need to view the DB Stats, propertyKeys,  or indexes to confirm the expected behavior.

[source,Cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)<-[:ACTED_IN]-(a)
WHERE m.name = $title
RETURN collect(a.name) AS Actors
----

Did you find any problems?

If so, correct the query.

== Exercise 2.3: Inspect a query for expected behavior (Solution)

Here is a query that you may be tuning. Check it out to make sure that it will perform correctly using the `EXPLAIN` clause:

*Hint*: You may need to view the DB Stats, propertyKeys,  or indexes to confirm the expected behavior.

[source,Cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)<-[:ACTED_IN]-(a)
WHERE m.name = $title
RETURN collect(a.name) AS Actors
----

Here is what the `EXPLAIN` yields:

image::explain1.png[explain1,width=600]

Did you find any problems?

*Answer*: This query was intending to use the title of the movie which is indexed. No index will be used. There is no such property, _name_ for a _Movie_ node.

If so, correct the query.

Here is what the query will be:

[source,Cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)<-[:ACTED_IN]-(a)
WHERE m.title = $title
RETURN collect(a.name) AS Actors
----

Here is what the `EXPLAIN` yields:

image::explain2.png[explain2,width=600]

== Exercise 2.4: Inspect another query for expected behavior (Instructions)

Here is another query that you may be tuning. Check it out to make sure that it will perform correctly using the `EXPLAIN` clause:

*Hint*: You may need to view the DB Stats, propertyKeys,  or indexes to confirm the expected behavior.

[source,Cypher]
----
MATCH (m)-[IS_GENRE]->(g)
RETURN collect(m.title) AS Movies, g.name
----

Did you find any problems?

Correct the problem and rerun.

== Exercise 2.4: Inspect another query for expected behavior (Solution)

Here is another query that you may be tuning. Check it out to make sure that it will perform correctly using the `EXPLAIN` clause:

*Hint*: You may need to view the DB Stats, propertyKeys,  or indexes to confirm the expected behavior.

[source,Cypher]
----
EXPLAIN
MATCH (m)-[IS_GENRE]->(g)
RETURN collect(m.title) AS Movies, g.name
----

Here is what the `EXPLAIN` yields:

image::explain3.png[explain3,width=600]

Did you find any problems?

*Answer*: For starters, this query will retrieve all nodes in the graph.
It then does the expansion to 81,094 rows. We know that this graph has 17,304 _IS_GENRE_ relationships total so the number of rows is not what we want.

Correct the problem and rerun.

[source,Cypher]
----
EXPLAIN
MATCH (m)-[:IS_GENRE]->(g:Genre)
RETURN collect(m.title) AS Movies, g.name
----

Here is what the `EXPLAIN` yields:

image::explain4.png[explain4,width=600]

We can use the count store to estimate rows to the _Genre_ nodes as the anchor of the query.
We know that there are only 35 _Genre_ nodes in the graph.
Furthermore, correcting the relationship enables us to focus only on _IS_GENRE_ relationships.
This is a much better execution plan.

== Exercise 2.5: Warm up the Page Cache (Instructions)

Write and execute a Cypher statement to warm up the Page Cache.

== Exercise 2.5: Warm up the Page Cache (Solution)

Write and execute a Cypher statement to warm up the Page Cache.

[source, cypher]
----
CALL apoc.warmup.run(true,true,true)
----

The result returned will be:

[.thumb]
image::warmUp.png[warmUp,width=600]

== Exercise 2.6: View the Page Cache information (Instructions)

Write and execute the Neo4j Browser command to view the Page Cache information.

== Exercise 2.6: Display the data model for this graph (Solution)

Write and execute the Neo4j Browser command to view the Page Cache information.

[source, cypher]
----
:sysinfo
----

The result returned will be:

[.thumb]
image::pagecache-sysinfo.png[pagecache-sysinfo,width=600]

You are now ready to begin query tuning!


== Exercise 2: Prepare for Query Tuning (Summary)
