== Exercise 6: Monitoring Running Queries (Preparations)

Before you begin this exercise, you must have this environment:

. Have a database that has access to the APOC library.

. If you have not populated the database yet, execute this Cypher code to populate the database:

[source,Cypher]
----
include::scripts/AfterExercise4.cypher[]
----

This is what you will see in the left panel for the database:

[start=3]
. Up until now in this course, you have been using a single Neo4j Browser session. For this exercise, you will need a second Neo4j Browser window that is connected to the same database.
.. If you have opened Neo4j Browser through *Neo4j Desktop* and your database is running locally, you can simply open a Web browser window and go to localhost:7474 to open a new Neo4j Browser session. You will be using this session for monitoring running queries.
You are now ready to start this exercise.
.. If you are using *Neo4j Aura*, simply open a new Neo4j Browser session to the same database.

You are now ready to start this exercise.

== Exercise 7: Monitoring Running Queries(Overview)

In this exercise, you gain some experience with monitoring and killing a long-running query.

Go to the next page to start this exercise.

== Exercise 7.1: Monitor and kill a long-running query. (Instructions)

Here is a query that will run for a long time:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) RETURN count(id(a))
----

. Execute this query in the Neo4j Browser session (main session) you have used throughout this training.

. In the monitoring Neo4j Browser session you started in a different window, monitor the queries using the `:queries` command.

. In the monitoring Neo4j Browser session, call the cypher procedure to kill the query.

== Exercise 7.1: Monitor and kill a long-running query. (Solution)

Here is a query that will run for a long time:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) RETURN count(id(a))
----

. Execute this query in the Neo4j Browser session (main session) you have used throughout this training.

. In the monitoring Neo4j Browser session you started in a different window, monitor the queries using the `:queries` command.

This is what you will see:

[start=3]
. In the monitoring Neo4j Browser session, call the cypher procedure to kill the query.

Here is the solution code:

[source, cypher]
----
CALL dbms.listQueries() YIELD query, queryId, elapsedTimeMillis
WHERE query STARTS WITH 'MATCH' AND elapsedTimeMillis > 5000
CALL dbms.killQuery(queryId) YIELD queryId as qid, message
RETURN "Query: " + " " +  qid +" " + message as result
----

The result of executing this code will be:

[.thumb]
image::EX7.1A.png[EX7.1A,width=600]

And again you will see the failure in your main Neo4j Browser session.

== Exercise 7: Monitoring Running Queries (Summary)

In this exercise, gained experience monitoring a long-running query and killing it.
