== About this module

[.notes]
--
You have learned how to query nodes and relationships in a graph using simple patterns. 
You learned how to use node labels, relationship types, and properties to filter your queries. 
Cypher provides a rich set of `MATCH` clauses and keywords you can use to get more out of your queries.
--

At the end of this module, you will be able to write Cypher `WHERE` clauses for testing:
[.small]
--
[square]
* Equality.
* Multiple values.
* Ranges.
* Labels.
* Existence of a property.
* String values.
* Regular expressions.
* Patterns in the graph.
* Inclusion in a list.
--

== Testing equality

[.notes]
--
You have learned how to specify values for properties of nodes and relationships to filter what data is returned from the `MATCH` and `RETURN` clauses. 
The format for filtering you have learned thus far only tests equality, where you must specify values for the properties to test with. 
What if you wanted more flexibility about how the query is filtered? 
For example, you want to retrieve all movies released after 2000, or retrieve all actors born after 1970 who acted in movies released before 1995. 
Most applications need more flexibility in how data is filtered.

The most common clause you use to filter queries is the `WHERE` clause that typically follows a `MATCH` clause.
In the `WHERE` clause, you can place conditions that are evaluated at runtime to filter the query. 
--

Previously, you learned to write simple query as follows:

[source,Cypher,role=noplay]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie {released: 2008}) 
RETURN p, m
----

Here is a way you specify the same query using the `WHERE` clause:

[source,Cypher,role=noplay]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie) 
WHERE m.released = 2008
RETURN p, m
----

== Testing multiple values


In this example, you can only refer to named nodes or relationships in a `WHERE` clause so remember that you must specify a variable for any node or relationship you are testing in the `WHERE` clause. 
The benefit of using a `WHERE` clause is that you can specify potentially complex conditions for the query. 

For example:

[source,Cypher,role=noplay]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
WHERE m.released = 2008 OR m.released = 2009
RETURN p, m
----

=== Example: Testing ranges

[.notes]
--
Not only can the equality `=` be tested, but you can test ranges, existence, strings, as well as specify logical operations during the query. 

Here is an example of specifying a range for filtering the query:
--

[source,Cypher,role=noplay]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie) 
WHERE m.released >= 2003 AND m.released <= 2004
RETURN p.name, m.title, m.released
----

Here is the result:

image::MoviesBetween2003And2004.png[MoviesBetween2003And2004,width=600,align=center]

=== Example: Specifying a range differently

You can also specify the same query as:

[source,Cypher,role=noplay]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie) 
WHERE 2003 <= m.released <= 2004
RETURN p.name, m.title, m.released
----

[.notes]
--
You can specify conditions in a `WHERE` clause that return a value of `true` or `false` (for example predicates). 
For testing numeric values, you use the standard numeric comparison operators. Each condition can be combined for runtime evaluation using the boolean operators `AND`, `OR`, `XOR`, and `NOT`.  
There are a number of numeric functions you can use in your conditions. 
See the _Neo4j Cypher Manual's_ section _Mathematical Functions_ for more information.

A special condition in a query is when the retrieval returns an unknown value called `null`. 
Read the _Neo4j Cypher Manual's_ section _Working with null_ to understand how  `null` values are used at runtime.
--

== Testing labels

ifndef::env-slides[]
Thus far, you have used the node labels to filter queries in a `MATCH` clause. 
You can filter node labels in the `WHERE` clause also:
endif::[]

[.is-half.left-column]
--
[.statement]
For example, these two Cypher queries:

[source,cypher,role=noplay]
----
MATCH (p:Person) 
RETURN p.name
----

[source,Cypher,role=noplay]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(:Movie {title: 'The Matrix'}) 
RETURN p.name
----
--

[.is-half.right-column]
--
[.statement]
can be rewritten using `WHERE` clauses as follows:

[source,Cypher,role=noplay]
----
MATCH (p)
WHERE p:Person
RETURN p.name
----

[source,Cypher,role=noplay]
----
MATCH (p)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m)
WHERE p:Person AND m:Movie AND m.title='The Matrix'
RETURN p.name
----

ifndef::env-slides[]
Here is the result of running this second query:
endif::[]

image::TestLabels.png[TestLabels,width=500,align=center]
--

[.notes]
--
Not all node labels need to be tested during a query. If your graph has multiple labels for the same node, filtering it by the node label will provide better query performance.
--

== Testing existence of a property

[.notes]
--
Recall that a property is associated with a particular node or relationship. 
A property is not associated with a node with a particular label or relationship type.  
In one of our queries earlier, we saw that the movie "Something's Gotta Give" is the only movie in the _Movie_ database that does not have a _tagline_ property. 
Suppose we only want to return the movies that the actor, _Jack Nicholson_ acted in with the condition that they must all have a tagline.

Here is the query to retrieve the specified movies where we test the existence of the _tagline_ property:
--

[source,Cypher,role=noplay]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
WHERE p.name='Jack Nicholson' AND exists(m.tagline)
RETURN m.title, m.tagline
----

ifndef::env-slides[]
Here is the result:
endif::[]

image::JackNicholsonMoviesWithTaglines.png[JackNicholsonMoviesWithTaglines,width=1100,align=center]

[IMPORTANT]
In Neo4j 4.3, `exists()` has been deprecated and may not work in future releases, but it still works in 4.3. In Neo4j 4.3 and later you can use `AND m.tagline IS NOT NULL`

== Testing strings

[.notes]
--
Cypher has a set of string-related keywords that you can use in your `WHERE` clauses to test string property values. 
You can specify `STARTS WITH`, `ENDS WITH`, and `CONTAINS`.
--

[.statement]
For example, to find all actors in the _Movie_ database whose first name is _Michael_, you would write:

[source,Cypher,role=noplay]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->()
WHERE p.name STARTS WITH 'Michael'
RETURN p.name
----

ifndef::env-slides[]
Here is the result:
endif::[]

image::ActorsNamedMichael.png[ActorsNamedMichael,width=800,align=center]

=== String comparisons are case-sensitive

[.notes]
--
Note that the comparison of strings is case-sensitive. 
There are a number of string-related functions you can use to further test strings. 
For example, if you want to test a value, regardless of its case, you could call the `toLower()` function to convert the string to lower case before it is compared.

--

[source,Cypher,role=noplay]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->()
WHERE toLower(p.name) STARTS WITH 'michael'
RETURN p.name
----


[NOTE]
In this example where we are converting a property to lower case, if an index has been created for this property, it will not be used at runtime.

[.notes]
--
See the _String functions_ section of the _Neo4j Cypher Manual_ for more information. 
It is sometimes useful to use the built-in string functions to modify the data that is returned in the query in the RETURN clause.
--

== Testing with regular expressions

[.notes]
--
If you prefer, you can test property values using regular expressions.
You use the syntax `=~` to specify the regular expression you are testing with.
Here is an example where we test the name of the _Person_ using a regular expression to retrieve all _Person_ nodes with a _name_ property that begins with 'Tom':
--

[source,Cypher,role=noplay]
----
MATCH (p:Person)
WHERE p.name =~'Tom.*'
RETURN p.name
----

[.statement]
Here is the result:

image::MatchTomsRegex.png[MatchTomsRegex,width=400,align=center]


[NOTE]
[.statement]
If you specify a regular expression. The index will never be used. In addition, the property value must fully match the regular expression.

== Example: Testing with patterns - 1

[.notes]
--
Sometimes during a query, you may want to perform additional filtering using the relationships between nodes being visited during the query. For example, during retrieval, you may want to exclude certain paths traversed. 
You can specify a `NOT` specifier on a pattern in a `WHERE` clause.
--

[.statement]
Here is an example where we want to return all _Person_ nodes of people who wrote movies:

[source,Cypher,role=noplay]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:WROTE]->(m:Movie)
RETURN p.name, m.title
----

[.statement]
Here is the result:

image::WroteMovies.png[WroteMovies,width=400,align=center]


==  Example: Testing with patterns - 2


[.statement]
Next, we modify this query to exclude people who directed that particular movie:

[source,Cypher,role=noplay]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:WROTE]->(m:Movie)
WHERE NOT exists( (p)-[:DIRECTED]->(m) )
RETURN p.name, m.title
----

[.statement]
Here is the result:

image::WroteMoviesNotDirected.png[WroteMoviesNotDirected,width=400, align=center]

== Example: Testing with patterns - 3

[.statement]
Here is another example where we want to find _Gene Hackman_ and the movies that he acted in with another person who also directed the movie.

[source,Cypher,role=noplay]
----
MATCH (gene:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)<-[:ACTED_IN]-(other:Person)
WHERE gene.name= 'Gene Hackman'
AND exists( (other)-[:DIRECTED]->(m) )
RETURN  gene, other, m
----
[.statement]
Here is the result:

image::ExistsPattern.png[ExistsPattern,width=400,align=center]

== Testing with list values

[.notes]
--
If you have a set of values you want to test with, you can place them in a list or you can test with an existing list in the graph. 
A Cypher list is a comma-separated set of values within square brackets.

You can define the list in the `WHERE` clause. 
During the query, the graph engine will compare each property with the values `IN` the list. 
You can place either numeric or string values in the list, but typically, elements of the list are of the same type of data. 
If you are testing with a property of a string type, then all the elements of the list will be strings.
--

[.statement]
In this example, we only want to retrieve _Person_ nodes of people born in 1965 or 1970:

[source,Cypher,role=noplay]
----
MATCH (p:Person)
WHERE p.born IN [1965, 1970]
RETURN p.name as name, p.born as yearBorn
----

ifndef::env-slides[]
Here is the result:
endif::[]

image::UsingIN.png[UsingIN,width=400,align=center]

=== Testing list values in the graph

[.notes]
--
You can also compare a value to an existing list in the graph. 

We know that the _:ACTED_IN_ relationship has a property, _roles_ that contains the list of roles an actor had in a particular movie they acted in. 
Here is the query we write to return the name of the actor who played _Neo_ in the movie _The Matrix_:
--

[source,Cypher,role=noplay]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[r:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
WHERE  'Neo' IN r.roles AND m.title='The Matrix'
RETURN p.name
----

ifndef::env-slides[]
Here is the result:
endif::[]

image::UsingINRoles.png[UsingINRoles,width=600,align=center]

In the course _Creating Nodes and Relationships in Neo4j 4.x_, you will learn how to create lists from your queries by aggregating data in the graph.
endif::[]

[NOTE]
There are a number of syntax elements of Cypher that we have not covered in this training. For example, you can specify `CASE` logic in your conditional testing for your `WHERE` clauses.
You can learn more about these syntax elements in the https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/[Neo4j Cypher Manual] and the https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-refcard/current/[Cypher Refcard].

[.statement]
Suppose you want to add a `WHERE` clause at the end of this statement to filter the results retrieved.

[source,Cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[rel]->(m:Movie)<-[:PRODUCED]-(:Person)
