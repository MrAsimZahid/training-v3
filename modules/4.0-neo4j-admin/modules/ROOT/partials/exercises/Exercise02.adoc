= Exercise #2: Managing the Neo4j instance
// for local preview
ifndef::imagesdir[:imagesdir: ../../images]

In this Exercise, you will stop and start the Neo4j instance and view its status and log file using the Docker Neo4j instance you verified in the previous exercise.

== Before you begin

Open a terminal on your system to access the Docker Neo4j instance.

== Exercise steps:

. View the status of neo4j:
+
[source,shell,role=noplay]
----
[sudo] docker logs neo4j
----
+
You will see something like this:
+
image::Status-docker.png[Status-docker,width=600,align=center]
+
[start=2]
. Stop the Neo4j instance and then view its status.
+
[source,shell,role=noplay]
----
[sudo] docker stop neo4j
----
+
[source,shell,role=noplay]
----
[sudo] docker logs neo4j
----
+
image::Stop_neo4j-docker.png[Stop_neo4j-docker,width=600,align=center]

[start=3]
. Examine the database directories created for this Neo4j instance.
+

. Examine the log files for this Neo4j instance.

image::ViewLogFilesDocker.png[ViewLogFilesDocker,width=600,align=center]

[NOTE]
The log files you see here are for advanced monitoring. To view the basic log file in the Docker Neo4j instance, you use the `docker logs` command.
