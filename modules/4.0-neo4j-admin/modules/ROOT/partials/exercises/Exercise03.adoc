= Exercise #3: Using `cypher-shell`
// for local preview
ifndef::imagesdir[:imagesdir: ../../images]

In this Exercise, you will log in to the Neo4j instance with `cypher-shell`, change the password for the Neo4j instance, and use both the system and user database.

== Before you begin

. Make sure you have a terminal window open where you have access to the Docker Neo4j instance for this course.
. Ensure that the Docker Neo4j instance is started.

== Exercise steps:

. Log into the database with `cypher-shell` using the default credentials of _neo4j/neo4j_.
+

[source,shell,role=noplay]
----
[sudo] docker exec -it neo4j bin/cypher-shell
----

. Enter a new password that you will remember for the Neo4j instance. Note that this is not the same password as the user, _neo4j_.
+

. Exit out of `cypher-shell`.
+

----
:exit
----

. Start a `cypher-shell` session providing the -u and -p arguments.
. Use the system database to view all databases served by this Neo4j instance.
+

. Use the _neo4j_ database and enter this Cypher statement:
+

----
:use neo4j
----
+
[source,Cypher,role=noplay]
----
CREATE (:Person {name: '<your name'});
----
+

image::CreatePersonDocker.png[CreatePersonDocker,width=1000,align=center]

[start=7]
. Enter this Cypher statement to retrieve the node you just created:
+
[source,Cypher,role=noplay]
----
MATCH (p:Person) RETURN p;
----
+
image::FindPersonDocker.png[FindPersonDocker,width=1000,align=center]

[start=8]
. Enter this Cypher statement to delete the node you just created:
+
[source,Cypher,role=noplay]
----
MATCH (p:Person) DELETE p;
----
+
image::DeletePersonDocker.png[DeletePersonDocker,width=1000,align=center]

[start=9]
. Exit out of cypher-shell.
. Create the directory, _files_ in your *$HOME/docker-neo4j* directory.
+

[source,shell,role=noplay]
----
cd ~/docker-neo4j
----
+
[source,shell,role=noplay]
----
mkdir files
----

. Download this file: https://data.neo4j.com/admin-neo4j/movies.cypher to the _files_ directory. This file contains the Cypher statements to load the database with movie data.
+
On OS X or Linux:
+
[source,shell,role=noplay]
----
cd files
----
+
[source,shell,role=noplay]
----
curl -O https://data.neo4j.com/admin-neo4j/movies.cypher
----
+
On Windows, enter the above URL in a Web browser to download it. Then move it to the *files* folder.

[start=12]
. Invoke `cypher-shell` using *movies.cypher* as input.
+
On OS X or Linux:
+
[source,shell,role=noplay]
----
cat ~/docker-neo4j/files/movies.cypher | docker exec --interactive neo4j bin/cypher-shell -u neo4j -p <passwordYouSpecified>
----
+
On Windows:
+
[source,shell,role=noplay]
----
type files\movies.cypher | docker exec --interactive neo4j bin/cypher-shell -u neo4j -p <passwordYouSpecified>
----

[start=13]
. Start `cypher-shell`.
+
[source,shell,role=noplay]
----
[sudo] docker exec -it neo4j bin/cypher-shell -u neo4j -p <passwordYouSpecified>
----

. Execute these statements to confirm that the data was loaded into the user database:
+
[source,Cypher,role=noplay]
----
CALL db.schema.visualization();
MATCH (p:Person) WHERE p.name = 'Tom Hanks' RETURN p;
----
+
You will see something like this:

image::ConfirmMovieDataDocker.png[ConfirmMovieDataDocker,width=1000,align=center]

[start=15]
. Exit `cypher-shell`.

== Exercise summary

You have now successfully started a `cypher-shell` client session that connects to the Neo4j instance.
You typically use `cypher-shell` to execute Cypher against a user database, but you can also use it to perform some management tasks against the Neo4j instance by accessing the system database.
