= Exercise #7: Checking consistency of a database
// for local preview
ifndef::imagesdir[:imagesdir: ../../images]

In this Exercise, you check the consistency of a database that is consistent. Then you modify a file that causes the database to become corrupt and then check its consistency.

== Before you begin

. Make sure you have a terminal window open to your Docker Neo4j instance for this course.
. Ensure that the Docker Neo4j instance is started.

== Exercise steps:

. Use `cypher-shell` to load the *movies.dump* data into a database named _movies2_.
. Use `cypher-shell` to create the _movies2_ database.
. Confirm that this database has 171 nodes.
. Stop the _movies2_ database.
. Create the directory *$HOME/docker-neo4j/logs/reports*.
. Make this new directory writable.
. Run the consistency check tool on *movies2* using `neo4j-admin` specifying *reports* as the directory where the report will be written.

[sudo] docker exec --interactive neo4j bin/neo4j-admin check-consistency --database=movies2 --report-dir=logs/reports

[NOTE]
You will see a few information messages about record formats which are specific to Docker Neo4j instances that you can safely ignore.

[start=8]
. Use `neo4j-admin` to load the *movies.dump* data into a database named _movies3_.
. Use `cypher-shell` to create the _movies3_ database.
. Confirm that this database has 171 nodes.
. Stop the _movies3_ database.
. Next, you will "maliciously" corrupt the database. Modify the file *data/new-location/databases/movies3/neostore.nodestore.db* by adding some text to the file.

. Run the consistency check tool on *movies3* using `neo4j-admin` specifying *logs/reports* as the directory where the report will be written. The consistency check tool will return something like the following:

. Use `cypher-shell` to drop the _movies3_ database.

== Exercise summary

You have now you checked the consistency of a database that is consistent. Then you modified a file that causes the database to become corrupt and then checked its consistency.
