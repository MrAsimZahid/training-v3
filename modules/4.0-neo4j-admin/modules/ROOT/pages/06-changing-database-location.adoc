== About this module
[.notes]
--
Next, you will learn how to set up the Neo4j instance to use a specific, non-default location for the databases.
--

At the end of this module, you will be able to:
[square]
* Modify the location where Neo4j databases are placed.

== Modifying the location of the database

[.notes]
--
If you do not want the databases used by the Neo4j instance to reside in the same location as the Neo4j installation, you can modify its location in the *neo4j.conf* file. If you specify a new location for the data, it must exist in the filesystem and the directory must be owned by _neo4j:neo4j_.
--

[.statement]
Here we have specified a new location for the data in the configuration file:

[.statement]
In addition, we have specified mainDB as the default database.

=== Best practice for configuration modifications

[.notes]
--
Here is a best practice you follow when managing a Neo4j installation.
It is easier to place all changed property values at the end of the *neo4j.conf* file.
That way, you can easily see what non-default values you have configured.

Here is an example:

=== Configuring Neo4j instance with a new location

[.small]
--
After you have modified the *neo4j.conf* file with the new location for the databases, you must:

. Ensure the directory exists.
. Change the owner of the directory to be neo4j.
. Start or restart the Neo4j instance.
. Confirm that the instance started with no errors.

=== Starting Neo4j instance with a new location

[.notes]
--
When you start the Neo4j instance using a different location for the databases, it first creates and starts a database named whatever you have specified as the default database.
If you did not specify the default database in the configuration file, it will create a database named _neo4j_.
--

[.statement]
Here are the new databases in the new location:

[.notes]
--
If you have existing databases that you want to reside in a different location for the Neo4j instance, remember that you must dump and load the databases to safely copy them to the new location.
--
==== Password change required

[.notes]
--
Just as you needed to change the password for the admin user, _neo4j_ the first time you accessed a database, you must do the same here for this new location of the Neo4j databases:

== Check your understanding

=== Question 1

[.statement]
What file must you modify if you want the location of the databases for your Neo4j instance to be located in a non-default directory?

[.statement]
Select the correct answer.

[%interactive.answers]
- [ ] *database.conf*
- [ ] *neo4j-database.conf*
- [ ] *neo4j-instance.conf*
- [x] *neo4j.conf*

=== Question 2

[.statement]
The directory/folder that will be used for the Neo4j instance databases must be owned by which user:group?

[.statement]
Select the correct answer.

[%interactive.answers]
- [ ] root:root
- [ ] neo4j:root
- [x] neo4j:neo4j
- [ ] root:neo4j

=== Question 3

[.statement]
Suppose you configure a new location for the databases for the Neo4j instance.
After the Neo4j instance starts, what are the first things you must do?

[.statement]
Select the correct answers.

[%interactive.answers]
- [ ] Create the system database.
- [ ] Create the user database.
- [x] Ensure the Neo4j instance successfully starts.
- [x] Change the password for the _neo4j_ user.

== Summary
