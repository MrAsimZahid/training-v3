== About this module

[.notes]
--
As an administrator, you may need to populate data in a database from files that were extracted from an RDBMS.
--

In this module, you will learn how to import data from CSV files using the `import` functionality of the `neo4j-admin` tool.

== Importing data

[.notes]
--
There are many ways that data can be imported into a Neo4j database where the source of the data is an RDBMS.
--

[.statement]
--
You have many options for importing data into Neo4j.
Which option you choose depends on:

[square]
* How much data you have.
* What tools you are comfortable using.
* How much time you have to perform the import.
--

== Options for importing data into Neo4j

image::ImportOptions.png[ImportOptions,width=900,align=center]

[.notes]
--
The developers of your application may be responsible for importing the data.
In other scenarios, you may be given a set of CSV files that will need to be imported into a database.
--

[.statement]
Using the `neo4j-admin` tool is by far the quickest way to import data into the database.

== CSV files for import

CSV files contain one of:

* row with header names
* rows with data
* header row and data

[.notes]
--
You must understand how headers relate to the data, what the field separator is, and make sure that the data is property formatted.
You must ensure that the data in the CSV files is clean and ready for import.
--

== Using neo4j-admin for import

[.notes]
--
When using neo4j-admin for import:
--

[.statement]
--
[square]
* The database to be imported into must not exist as it will be created as part of the import.
* The header information has additional information used for creating the nodes and relationships.
* Node CSV files are structured differently from relationship CSV files.
* All CSV files must use the same field separator.
* You create the constraints (and indexes) after the import.
--

=== Example: CSV file for nodes: Beat

[.statememt]
Here is portion of the *beats.csv* file with embedded header information for loading nodes of type _Beat_:

[source,CSV,role=nocopy noplay]
----
id:ID(beat-ref),:LABEL
1132,Beat
0813,Beat
0513,Beat
----

[.notes]
--
The *beats.csv* records represent data that will be loaded into a node with the label _Beat_.
The _id_ value is used to create the _id_ property for the node.
The ID(beat-ref) is used to store a reference to the node that is created so that it can be used later in the import.
--

=== Example: CSV files for nodes: Crime

[.statement]
Here is an example of the *crimes_header.csv* header file for loading nodes of type _Crime_:

[source,CSV,role=nocopy noplay]
----
id:ID(crime-ref),:LABEL,date,description
----

[.statement]
And here is a portion of the associated *crimes.csv* file for loading nodes of type _Crime_:

[source,CSV,role=nocopy noplay]
----
8920441,Crime,12/07/2012 07:50:00 AM,AUTOMOBILE
4730813,Crime,05/09/2006 08:20:00 AM,POCKET-PICKING
7150780,Crime,09/28/2009 01:00:00 AM,CHILD ABANDONMENT
4556970,Crime,12/16/2005 08:39:24 PM,POSS: CANNABIS 30GMS OR LESS
9442492,Crime,12/28/2013 12:15:00 PM,OVER $500
----

[.notes]
--
The _id_ value is used to create the _id_ property for the node. The label for the node will be _Crime_.
The _date_ and _description_ values are used to create the respective properties for each node.
The ID(crime-ref) is used to store a reference to the node that is created so that it can be used later in the import.
--

=== Example: CSV file for nodes: PrimaryType

[%unbreakable]
--

[.statement]
Here is a portion of the *primaryTypes.csv* file for loading these nodes:

[source,CSV,role=nocopy noplay]
----
id:ID(primarytype-ref)
ARSON
OBSCENITY
ROBBERY
THEFT
CRIM SEXUAL ASSAULT
BURGLARY
----
--

[.notes]
--
The _id_ value is used to create the _id_ property for the node.
The label to be used for creating the node is not specified in the header or the data so it will need to be specified in our argument to perform the import.
--

=== CSV files for relationships

[.notes]
--
CSV files for loading relationships contain a row for every relationship where the ID for the starting and ending node is specified, as well as the relationship type.
--

[.statement]
Here is a portion of the *crimesBeats.csv* file that will be used to create the _:ON_BEAT_ relationships between _Crime_ and _Beat_ nodes:

[source,CSV,role=nocopy noplay]
----
:START_ID(crime-ref),:END_ID(beat-ref),:TYPE
6978096,0911,ON_BEAT
3170923,2511,ON_BEAT
3073515,1012,ON_BEAT
8157905,0113,ON_BEAT
----

[.notes]
--
When the import tool processes this file, it has already saved references to the _Crime_ and _Beat_ nodes previously created.
We specify the relationship to be created between the _Crime_ and _Beat_ nodes using the _:TYPE_ column, in this case, _ON_BEAT_.
--

[.statement]
Here is a portion of a portion of the *crimesPrimaryTypes.csv* file that will be used to create the  relationships between the _Crime_ nodes and the nodes that contain the _CrimeType_ data:

[source,CSV,role=nocopy noplay]
----
:START_ID(crime-ref),:END_ID(primarytype-ref)
5221115,NARCOTICS
4522835,DECEPTIVE PRACTICE
3432518,BATTERY
6439993,CRIMINAL TRESPASS
----

[.notes]
--
When the import tool processes this file, it has already saved references to the _Crime_ and _PrimaryType_ nodes previously created.
There is no relationship specified in the data so we need to specify it in our argument when we import the data.

The relationship, _:TYPE_ is not specified in this file so it will be specified in the arguments when you load the data from this file.
--

== Importing the data

[.notes]
--
After you have created or obtained the CSV files for the data, you import the data.
The data import creates a database so the database you specify must either be empty or not exist.
--

[.statement]
Here is the simplified syntax for creating a database from CSV files:

[source,syntax,role=nocopy noplay]
----
neo4j-admin import
  --database <database-name>
  --nodes [<rheader-csv-file-1>,]<csv-file-1>
  --nodes=<Label>=[<rheader-csv-file-2>,]<csv-file-2>
  --relationships [<jheader-csv-file-1>,]<join-csv-file-1>
  --relationships=<REL_TYPE>=[<jheader-csv-file-2>,]<join-csv-file-2>
  --trim-strings=true
----

[.notes]
--
This simplified syntax shows examples of specifying the Label for a node CSV file as well as a relationship type for a relationship CSV file
In most cases, you will want to use the _trim-strings_ argument to ensure that leading or trailing spaces are not included in the data imported.
--

[NOTE]
You must *not* have a space after the "," when specifying a header file with the CSV file.

[.notes]
--
Refer to the https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/4.0/[Neo4j Operations Manual] for details for using the import tool.
Note that it is possible to specify regular expressions for the files specified when you import.
--
