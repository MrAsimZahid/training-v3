== About this module

[.notes]
--
Next, you will learn the ways that  you can copy a database.
--

At the end of this module, you will be able to:
[square]
* Copy a Neo4j database using the copy command.
* Create a dump file for a database.
* Load a dump file to create a database.

== Copying a Neo4j database

[.notes]
--
You or one of your application developers may want to copy a Neo4j database.
Perhaps the developers are at a juncture in their development where they want to save what they have worked on thus far.
Or perhaps they want to give a copy of the database to another developer to work with on a different system.

The structure of a Neo4j database is proprietary and could change from one release to another.
You must [underline]#never# copy the database files from one location in the filesystem/network to another location.
--
[.statement]
--
There are two ways that you can copy a database:

[square]
* Create a copy within the same Neo4j instance.
* Create a copy (dump file) that you will give to another developer to load into their Neo4j instance running on a different system.

Before you copy a database it must be stopped.
--

[.notes]
--
Later in this training, you will learn how to back up a database while it is online.
--

=== Copying a database within the same Neo4j instance

[.notes]
--
To copy a database within the same Neo4j instance, the source database must be stopped.
Additionally, the target database that you will be creating must not exist.

You use the `neo4j-admin` tool to copy a database within your Neo4j instance. Here are the steps:
--

[.small]
--
. Ensure the Neo4j instance is started.
. In `cypher-shell` stop the source database you want to copy:
+

[source,syntax,role=nocopy noplay]
----
:USE system
STOP DATABASE <sourceDB>;
----
. In a different terminal window, enter this as the user, neo4j:
+

[source,syntax,role=nocopy noplay]
----
/usr/bin/neo4j-admin copy --from-database=<sourceDB> --to-database=<targetDB>
----

. In `cypher-shell`  again:
+

[source,syntax,role=nocopy noplay]
----
CREATE DATABASE <targetDB>;
----

--

[.notes]
--
There are other options you can use to customize what is copied. See the https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/4.0/[Neo4j Operations Manual] for details.
--

=== Creating a dump file from a database

[.notes]
--
To create a dump file of a database, you must:
--

[.small]
--
. Ensure the Neo4j instance is started.
. In `cypher-shell`, stop the database you want to dump:
+

[source,syntax,role=nocopy noplay]
----
:USE system
STOP DATABASE <sourceDB>;
----

. Ensure that the directory where you will dump the database exists.
. As the neo4j users, you can use the `dump` command of the `neo4j-admin` tool to create the dump file as follows:
+

[source,syntax,role=nocopy noplay]
----
/usr/bin/neo4j-admin dump --database=<sourceDB> --to=<absolute path to dump file>
----

Note that the user, neo4j, must have write access to the directory.
--

[.notes]
--
This will create a  dump file that can now be transferred between systems to create a new database on a different system.
--

=== Creating a database from a dump file

[.notes]
--
Then, if you want to create a database from any dump file (offline backup) to use for a Neo4j instance, you must:
--

. Use the `load` command of the `neo4j-admin` tool as the neo4j user, to create the database from the dump file as follows:
+

[source,syntax,role=nocopy noplay]
----
/usr/bin/neo4j-admin load --database=<targetDB> --from=<absolute path to dump file>
----

. In `cypher-shell` create the database:
+

[source,syntax,role=nocopy noplay]
----
:USE system
CREATE DATABASE <targetDB>;
----
