== About this course

This course introduces you to how to develop a graph data model for an application using Neo4j best practices.

[.notes]
--
This course is intended for developers and architects.
You need not have programming experience to take this training, but you will have a solid understanding of what Neo4j is and how graph components are used in a Neo4j database.
--

In this course, you complete hands-on exercises to gain experience with developing graph data models for use with Neo4j.

To complete the hands-on exercises for this course, you need a Web browser and Internet access.

Welcome to this course on - +
an *introduction to - Graph Data Modeling - for Neo4j*. +
*Please* let me know if you cannot see my screen?

My name is ----. Iâ€™ll be the instructor for this course.

I'm looking forward to our time together as you learn how to *model data* for your Neo4j graph applications.

* This course is made up of roughly equal parts of *presentation* and *hands-on exercises*.
* I'm looking forward to a good discussion throughout the course, -
** since it enhances the learning experience.
* With that in mind, -
** please feel free to interrupt me at any time with whatever questions you might have.

In the *Introduction to Neo4j* course covered information on -

* *graph theory*, -
* how *graph databases* differ from *traditional databases*, -
* and how to work with *Cypher* to add objects to a graph and to extract data from the graph.

This course focuses primarily on concepts.

* We'll work on *understanding* data modeling and the *value* that they provide.
* We'll also look at data modeling *workflow*, -
** do some *white boarding* of data models, -
** and explore how to *evaluate data models*.
