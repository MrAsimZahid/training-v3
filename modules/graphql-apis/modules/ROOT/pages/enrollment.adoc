== About The Course

This online course introduces you to the Neo4j GraphQL library and how to build Node.js GraphQL APIs backed by Neo4j. Each module consists of lessons, code examples, hands-on exercises, and quizzes that cover features of the Neo4j GraphQL Library. The course focuses on the backend aspects of building a GraphQL API and does not cover concepts such as integrating GraphQL into a front-end application. During the course we will build the GraphQL API for an online bookstore application.

== Prerequisites

The successful participant must be familiar with Node.js JavaScript concepts. No prior experience with GraphQL or Neo4j is required, however this course focuses on building GraphQL APIs backed by Neo4j and will not cover Neo4j in detail so we recommend completing the "Overview of Neo4j 4.x" course.

== Duration

This course is designed to be completed in approximately 4 hours.
