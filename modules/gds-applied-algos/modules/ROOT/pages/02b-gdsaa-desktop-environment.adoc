== Setting up the Yelp dataset in Neo4j Desktop

To complete this course, you will use a combination of Neo4j Desktop for hosting the database and your Web application development environment.

[#yelp-dataset-agreement]
--
Before downloading the Yelp data, you need to read and agree to the {uri-yelp-dataset-agreement-pdf}[Yelp Dataset License^].
--

Perform these steps to set up the Yelp dataset in your Neo4j Desktop environment:

. https://neo4j-sandbox-usecase-datastores.s3.amazonaws.com/dump/yelp-41.dump[Download the dump file^,id=yelp-create-sandbox-link]
. Ensure that you have no databases started or connected to in Neo4j Desktop.
. Create a project
. Drag the downloaded *yelp-40.dump* file to the *Files* location in your project.
. Click the three dots to the right of the dump file name and select *Create DBMS from dump*.
. Enter a password for the database and then click *Create*.
. Open the details for the DBMS you are working with.
. Click the *Plugins* tab.
. Install *APOC*.
. Install *Graph Data Science Library*.
. Start the DBMS.
. Connect to the DBMS with Neo4j Browser.
. Verify that the nodes and relationships exist in the graph.

You can also follow along with this video for setting up the Yelp dataset in your Neo4j Desktop environment.

[NOTE]
This video is shown with an earlier version of Neo4j Desktop so you will need to adapt for the latest version of Neo4j Desktop.

Neo4j Browser Guides are documents that embed text, images, and Cypher queries inside Neo4j Browser in a carousel-like series of slides. We use Neo4j Browser Guides to show how to use graph algorithms in Cypher and Neo4j. Each module will have a browser guide to help "guide" you through the content.
--

You can access the guides for this course by running this command in Neo4j Browser.

== React Web Application

Since this an applied course, we want to see how to enhance features of an actual application.
You will use an existing React application for this part of the course. 
The application is available as a https://github.com/neo4j-graph-analytics/data-science-course-react-app[GitHub repository].

Perform these five steps to set up your development environment:

. Clone the github repository by running `git clone https://github.com/neo4j-graph-analytics/data-science-course-react-app.git`.
. Run `npm install` inside the repository folder.
. Edit the *.env* file by replacing the default environment variables with the credentials for your Yelp Neo4j Desktop instance.
. Run `npm start` to start the application.

=== Building a business reviews application

You will build your own version of yelp.com using this data.
You will use graph algorithms to improve the quality of results in the application.

The rest of the course will follow this structure:

* Introduction to an algorithm.
* Learn how to execute the algorithm using Cypher in Neo4j Browser.
* Use the Cypher and updated graph to improve the React application.
