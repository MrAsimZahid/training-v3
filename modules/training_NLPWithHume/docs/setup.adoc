== Preparing for the training session

You must prepare your development environment before you perform the exercises for this training session.

*Step 1:* Download this license file as you will need it for running Hume

https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/setup/hume/hume-api_nodes2020_2020-10-31.lic

[NOTE]
This license file expires October 31, 2020. You can request a new license file by emailing info@graphaware.com.

*Step 2:* Follow the setup instructions here:

https://github.com/graphaware/hume-nodes2020

*Step 3:* Before your start the Docker instance, you will need to configure it to use at least 12-16G of RAM. Please follow these instructions per your system:

* https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#resources
* https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#resources

[NOTE]
Because of the size of the configuration, it will take time for processes to start when you begin your hands-on exercises.
