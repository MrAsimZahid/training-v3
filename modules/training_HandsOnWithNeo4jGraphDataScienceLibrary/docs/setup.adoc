== Preparing for the course

You must prepare your development environment before you take this training session, Hands on with Neo4j's Graph Data Science Library
To prepare for this course, you must do the following before this session (scroll down for detailed instructions):

. Ensure that you have the latest Neo4j Desktop (1.3.5 or later) installed on your laptop.
. Create the project and database for this training.
. Install plugins for the database.
. Download the PaySim fraud database dump file and load it.
. Modify the Neo4j configuration.
. Verify your setup.

== Step 1: Install latest version of Neo4j Desktop

If you do not have Neo4j Desktop installed, https://neo4j.com/download-center/#desktop[download] version 1.3.5 or later and install it.

If you already have Neo4j Desktop installed, but is is not up to version 1.3.5 or later, upgrade by selecting *Neo4j Desktop -> Check for updates*.


== Step 2: Create the project and Neo4j instance for this training

. In Neo4j Desktop, create a new project named *Fraud*

. In this new project, create a graph of version 4.1.1. Don't forget to type a password for this database.

== Step 3: Install plugins for this database

For this training, you will use the GDS and APOC plugins. Do NOT install the Graph Algorithms plugin!

. Go to the Manage area for the Fraud database you just created.

. Install the GDS and APOC plugins. (Do NOT install the Graph Algorithms plugin)

. Start the database.

== Step 4: Download the PaySim database dump file and load it

. Download the dump file:  https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/setup/GDS-Paysim/paysim_v2_4.1.1.dump
. For database you created earlier, open a terminal window.
. In the terminal window type: bin/neo4j-admin load --from=<absolute path to the paysim_v2_4.1.1.dump file> --database=paysim
. In Neo4j Browser:
.. Connect to the Neo4j instance you started.
.. Type CREATE database paysim
.. Type :use paysim
. Confirm that the paysim database is accessible.

== Step 5: Modify the Neo4j Configuration

. In the Manage area for the database, click the *Settings* tab.
. Modify the default initial heap size, max heap size, and page cache memory configuration as follows:
.. dbms.memory.heap.initial_size=2G
.. dbms.memory.heap.max_size=2G
.. dbms.memory.pagecache.size=2G
. Click *Apply* to save your changes.
. Restart the database instance.

== Step 6: Verify your setup

. After the database starts, you will see 332,948 nodes and 979,772 relationships in the database.
. Open Neo4j Browser for the started fraud database.
. Enter these statements:
.. RETURN gds.version() // It will return 1.3.3
.. RETURN apoc.version() // It will return 4.1.0.2


*Congratulations!* You are now ready to perform the exercises for this training session.
