== Exercise

. In Neo4j Browser, perform the steps in the  Neo4j Browser guide section *Photo Recommendations*. (:play applied_graph_algorithms/05_photo_recommendations.html)
. In CodeSandbox, edit the `FETCH_PHOTO_RECOMMENDATIONS` Cypher query in `src/exercises/exercise4.js` to recommend businesses whose photos belong to the same community.
. Save this file.
. In the CodeSandbox Browser, click *Photos* and select five random photos. Then the application presents restaurants based upon the photos selected.
