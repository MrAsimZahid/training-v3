== About this topic

You have learned how to retrieve nodes from the graph and how to filter what nodes are retrieved either by a node label or by property values.
Nodes are related to other nodes in the graph and their relationships are an important part of the data model for your application.

In topic, you will learn how to retrieve data from the graph where the relationships between nodes is significant.
This is another way that you can filter what data is retrieved from the graph.

At the end of this topic, you should be able to:

[square]
* Retrieve nodes based upon their relationship to other nodes in the graph.
* Retrieve node patterns with multiple relationships.
* Determine a relationship type between nodes retrieved.
* Retrieve nodes filtering by property values in a relationship.

== Relationship patterns in the graph

In your `MATCH` clause, you specify how you want a relationship to be used to perform the query.

Earlier you learned of how you can specify relationship patterns in the graph:

[source,syntax,role=nocopy noplay]
----
()--()            // 2 nodes have some type of relationship
()-[]-()          // 2 nodes have some type of relationship
()-[:RATED]-()    // 2 nodes have the RATED relationship between them
()-->()           // the first node has a relationship to the second node
()<--()           // the second node has a relationship to the first node
()-[:RATED]->()   // the first node has the RATED relationship to the second node
----

In a query, a relationship can be specified with or without direction.
It can also be anonymous, meaning that the relationship type is not specified in the pattern.
When an anonymous relationship pattern is used, any relationship is used for the retrieval.
When a relationship type is specified, we use the `:<relationshipType>` syntax.


== Examining relationships in the graph

Recall that you can view the relationship types in the graph and how they are used to connect nodes.

//T: execute

Run this Cypher code to view the relationships in the sample graph:

[source,Cypher]
----
CALL db.schema.visualization()
----

The Person node has the same relationships to the Movie node as the Director and Actor nodes.
All relationships are from Person, Director, Actor, and User nodes to Movie nodes which include:

[square]
* ACTED_IN
* DIRECTED
* RATED

The only relationship from a Movie node to another node, is the `IN_GENRE` relationship to a Genre node.

== Using a relationship in a query

Here is an example where we retrieve the _Person_ nodes that have the _ACTED_IN_ relationship to the _Movie_, _Toy Story_.
In other words, show me the actors that acted in _Toy Story_.
endif::[]

//T: execute

Run this Cypher code:

[source,Cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[rel:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie {title: 'Toy Story'})
RETURN p, rel, m
----

//T: execute

Click the graph view:

In the graph view, you see the four _Person_ nodes and one _Movie_ node and their relationships.
This query returns nodes and relationships.

//T: execute

Click the table view:

In the table view, we see 4 records. Because we are returning _p, rel, m_, each row contains the data for each item returned.
The _m_ cell is repeated for each row.

//Q3: More effort (modify Cypher)

Modify this query to retrieve the _Person_ nodes that have the _DIRECTED_ relationship to the _Movie_, _Toy Story_.
//answer
//MATCH (p:Person)-[rel:DIRECTED->(m:Movie {title: 'Toy Story'})
//RETURN p, rel, m

//Q3: More effort (modify Cypher)

Modify this query to return the names of the people who acted in the movie, Toy Story:

//answer
//MATCH (p:Person)-[rel:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie {title: 'Toy Story'})
//RETURN p.name

=== Specify labels whenever possible

You specify node labels whenever possible in your queries as it optimizes the retrieval in the graph engine.
That is, you should *not* specify the previous query as:

[source,Cypher]
----
MATCH (p)-[rel:ACTED_IN]->(m {title:'Toy Story'})
RETURN p,rel,m
----

This query returns the same results.
But, in a large graph, this query will work, but it will not be as performant as the query where you specify the node label.

== Querying by multiple relationships

You can specify multiple relationships if you want to possibly expand the subgraph returned.
For example, Tom Hanks acted in and directed movies.
This query returns all of the titles of movies that Tom Hanks acted in or directed.

//T: execute

Run this Cypher code:

[source,Cypher]
----
MATCH (:Person {name: 'Tom Hanks'})-[:ACTED_IN|DIRECTED]->(m:Movie)
RETURN  m.title
----

What this query is retrieving is the node/relationship/node triples that satisfy the pattern.
That is, a Tom Hanks node that has an ACTED_IN relationship to movie nodes or a Tom Hanks node that has a _DIRECTED_ relationship to movie nodes.
In the sample graph, there are 38 _ACTED_IN_ relationships from Tom Hanks and 2 _DIRECTED_ relationships from Tom Hanks.
The pattern specifies `|` for the relationship so all of these relationships are retrieved.
If we were to return p,m, we would find that there is duplication in the movie nodes.
That is, Tom Hanks both acted in and directed the movie, Larry Crowne.
This query returns 40 titles, with a title duplicated

== Using DISTINCT to eliminate duplication

You can eliminate this problem of duplication by pre-pending the Cypher keyword `DISTINCT` before the specification of the _m.title_ value in the `RETURN` clause.

//T: execute

Run this Cypher code to see that the duplicate title is eliminated:

[source,Cypher]
----
MATCH (:Person {name: 'Tom Hanks'})-[:ACTED_IN|DIRECTED]->(m:Movie)
RETURN  DISTICT m.title
----

== Retrieving the relationship types


There is a built-in function, `type()` that returns the type of a relationship.
This function is useful if you want to be more introspective of your traversal in the graph and discover what the relationship is between nodes.
You would generally use this when you return a variable for an anonymous relationship

Here is an example where we use the _rel_ variable to hold the relationships retrieved.
We then use this variable to return the relationship types.


//T: execute

Run this Cypher code to see the names of people associated with the movie, Toy Story and what their relationship is:

[source,Cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[rel]->(:Movie {title:'Toy Story'})
RETURN p.name, type(rel)
----

Notice also that we are not using a variable for the _Movie_ node since we are not returning it.

//Q3: More effort (modify Cypher)

Modify the previous query to return the names for any nodes in the graph (not just _Person_ nodes) with are relationship to the movie, Toy Story.

//answer
//MATCH (p)-[rel]->(:Movie {title:'Toy Story'})
//RETURN p.name, type(rel)

== Properties for relationships

Recall that a node can have as set of properties, each identified by its property key.
Relationships can also have properties.
This enables your graph model to provide more data about the relationships between the nodes.

Here is the next scenario you will be working with.
The movie, Toy Story had several people rate it. These are _User_ nodes with the _RATED_ relationship to _Movie_ nodes.

Write a query that returns the person's name and the relationship to the Toy Story movie.
*Hint*: You should return the entire relationship so you can examine its properties.

//Q4: Most effort (write Cypher)
//answer
//MATCH (u:User)-[rel:RATED]->(:Movie {title:'Toy Story'})
//RETURN u.name, rel

Examine the properties for the relationships returned.

//Q3: More effort (modify Cypher)

Modify the previous query to return the names for any nodes in the graph (not just _Person_ nodes) with are relationship to the movie, Toy Story.

//answer
//MATCH (u:User)-[rel:RATED]->(:Movie {title:'Toy Story'})
//RETURN u.name, rel.rating

== Ordering results returned

For the last query, it might be useful to order the values returned in rating order.
You can add the Cypher phrase `ORDER BY rel.rating` to to `RETURN` clause to order the results.

//Q3: More effort (modify Cypher)

Modify the previous query to return the names for any nodes in the graph (not just _Person_ nodes) with are relationship to the movie, Toy Story.

//answer
//MATCH (u:User)-[rel:RATED]->(:Movie {title:'Toy Story'})
//RETURN u.name, rel.rating ORDER BY rel.rating

[NOTE]
You can specify `DESC` after the property to reverse the order.

== Filtering using relationship properties


Just as you can specify property values for filtering nodes for a query, you can specify property values for a relationship.

This query returns the name of of the person who gave the movie, Toy Story a rating of _1.0_

//T: execute

Execute this query:

[source,Cypher,role=noplay]
----
MATCH (u:User)-[:RATED {rating: 1.0}]->(:Movie {title:'Toy Story'})
RETURN u.name AS `Rater name`
----

//Q3: More effort (modify Cypher)

Modify the previous query to return the names of people who gave movies a rating of .5 and what movie they rated as such.

//answer
//MATCH (u:User)-[:RATED {rating: .5}]->(m:Movie)
//RETURN u.name AS `Rater name`, m.title as Title
