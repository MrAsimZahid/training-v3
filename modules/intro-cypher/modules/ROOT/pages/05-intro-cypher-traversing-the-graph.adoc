== About this topic

Now that you have gained experience with retrieving nodes and relationships, you will learn more about how the query processor traverses the graph to retrieve data.

At the end of this topic, you should be able to:

== Patterns in the graph

Thus far, you have learned how to specify nodes, properties, and relationships in your Cypher queries.
Since relationships are directional, it is important to understand how patterns are used in graph traversal during query execution.
How a graph is traversed for a query depends on what directions are defined for relationships and how the pattern is specified in the `MATCH` clause.

Here is an example where the _ACTED_IN_ relationship is defined as the relationship from an _Actor_ node to a _Movie_ node.

== Using patterns for queries

Run this query that returns all _Actor_ nodes who acted in Toy Story.

//T: execute

[source,Cypher]
----
MATCH  (a:Actor)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie {title:'Toy Story'})
RETURN a, m
----


For this query the _Movie_ node for Toy Story is the anchor of the query.
It is the first node that is retrieved from the graph.
Then the graph engine looks for all  _ACTED_IN_ relationships _into_ this node and retrieves them.
In the sample graph, four _Actor_ nodes are retrieved.

== Traversal does not need direction in the pattern

If we were to not specify the direction of the relationship in this query, we would find that the exact same results are returned:

//T: execute

Run this query:

[source,Cypher]
----
MATCH  (a:Actor)-[:ACTED_IN]-(m:Movie {title:'Toy Story'})
RETURN a, m
----

The graph engine knows that there is a relationship between _Actor_ and _Movie_ nodes so the same traversal occurs.

=== Direction can be significant

If we reverse the direction in the pattern, the query does not return any results.
endif::[]

//T: execute

Run this query:

[source,Cypher]
----
MATCH  (a:Actor)<-[:ACTED_IN]-(m:Movie {title:'Toy Story'})
RETURN a, m
----

This pattern is not represented in the graph which is why no nodes are returned.
The anchor node is retrieved, but no nodes are found in the graph with the specified relationship to _Actor_ nodes.
So this pattern yields no nodes returned.

[NOTE]
A best practice is to specify direction in your `MATCH` statements. This will optimize queries, especially for larger graphs.

== Traversing multiple relationships

Since we have a graph, we can traverse through nodes to obtain relationships further into the traversal.

For example, we can write a Cypher query to return all movies that the actors in the Toy Story movie acted in.

//T: execute

Run this query:

[source,Cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie {title:"Toy Story"})<-[:ACTED_IN]-(a:Actor)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m2)
RETURN m, a, m2
----

For this query the _Movie_ node for Toy Story is the anchor.
The graph engine then looks for all _Actor_ nodes with the _ACTED_IN_ relationship to this _Movie_ node.
Then it looks for all _Movie_ nodes related to the _Actor_ nodes found. For example, it finds all movies that Don Rickles acted in.

As you gain more experience with Cypher, you will see how patterns in your queries enable you to focus on the relationships in the graph.


Write a query that returns unique Genre names of all Movies that Tom Hanks acted in.

//Q4: Most effort (write Cypher)
//answer
//MATCH (:Actor {name: 'Tom Hanks'})-[:ACTED_IN]->(:Movie)-[:IN_GENRE]->(g:Genre)
//RETURN DISTINCT g.name

== Returning paths

In the visualization of the results returned, if you return nodes and they have relationships, the relationships will be shown in the visualization because by default, Neo4j Browser connects nodes.

Your queries can also return subgraphs which are the traversal paths encountered in the `MATCH` clause.

Here is how you can return a subgraph.
If you were to uncheck the setting in Neo4j Browser to not connect nodes in the visualization, you would find that this query returns what you have seen before.


//T: execute

Uncheck the setting to connect nodes and then run this query:

[source,Cypher]
----
MATCH  subGraph = ((:Movie {title:"Toy Story"})<-[:ACTED_IN]-(:Actor)-[:ACTED_IN]->())
RETURN subGraph
----
