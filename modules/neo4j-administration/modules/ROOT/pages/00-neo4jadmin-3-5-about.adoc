== About this course

This course introduces you to Neo4j and some of the most common administration tasks for a production Neo4j application using *Neo4j Enterprise Edition 3.5*.

This course is intended for administrators.

This self-paced training will take you 6-7 hours to complete if you perform all of the hands-on exercises in the course.  You need not complete the course in one session. At then end of each module are a set of review questions and we keep track of which modules you answered the questions correctly. If you answer all of the review questions correctly, we will email you a _Certificate of Completion_ for this online training.

We have set up a discussion area in our https://community.neo4j.com/c/general/online-training[Neo4j Community Site], if you run into problems in the course and need assistance. Register on the community site  where you can view other questions and answers for students taking our online training courses. The _Neo4j Community Site_ is an  excellent resource for answering many types of questions posed by other users of Neo4j.

There are six lessons in this course. Most modules have hands-on exercises you will complete as well as a set of review questions at the end. In order to perform the hands-on exercises for this course, you will need to install the Enterprise Edition of Neo4j which is covered in the module, _Overview of Neo4j Administration_. For the module, _Causal Clustering in Neo4j_ you will need to install Docker.  We have provided an estimate of how long each module will take you to complete if you perform the hands-on exercises.
