== Overview

You should bring a laptop to the class that is properly set up for the class.

You may choose to use your personal laptop rather than your work laptop for this course if:
[square]
* Your work laptop blocks or restricts Internet access.
* You want to install Neo4j Desktop and you do not have admin privileges for your work laptop.

To prepare your laptop for this course, you must perform these three Steps:

Select an Option (1,2) for your development environment and prepare your laptop for the selected option.

When performing the hands-on exercises for this course, you have two options:

*Option 1: Install and use Neo4j Desktop on your laptop (preferred approach)*
[square]
* You must download and install Neo4j Desktop before coming to the class.
* You must prepare your Neo4j Desktop environment for this course.
* Neo4j Desktop is available on Windows, OS X, and Linux (must be a 64-bit system).
* Neo4j Desktop is free to use for development.
* All databases are created and used on your local system.
* You access the database with the Neo4j Browser application running locally on your system.
* WiFi capability during the class is optional, but recommended. It is possible to use Neo4j Desktop offline since the Neo4j Database is running locally.

*Option 2: Use a Neo4j Sandbox (a temporary Neo4j instance)*
[square]
* You must set up a Neo4j Sandbox account before coming to the class.
* A Neo4j Sandbox instance is free to use.
* Sandbox instance is available for 3 days, but can be extended to 10 days.
* You access your database for this course using a Web browser.
* Your laptop must have WiFi capability that does not block Internet sites.

Which option you use for this course will depend on your needs, but you must prepare one of them before coming to the class.

== Option 1: Using Neo4j Desktop

The Neo4j Desktop includes the Neo4j Database server which includes the graph engine and kernel so that Cypher statements can be executed to access a database on your system.
It includes an application called  Neo4j Browser.
Neo4j Browser enables you to access a Neo4j database using Cypher.
You can also call built-in procedures that communicate with the database server.
There are a number of additional libraries and drivers for accessing the Neo4j database from Cypher or from another programming language that you can install in your development environment.

Neo4j Desktop runs on OS X, Linux, and Windows.
