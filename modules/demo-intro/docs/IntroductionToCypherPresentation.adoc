== What is Cypher?

[.two-columns]
--
* Declarative query language
* Focuses on _what_, not how to retrieve
* Uses keywords such as `MATCH`, `WHERE`, `CREATE`
* Runs in the database server for the graph
* ASCII art to represent nodes and relationships

Being a declarative language, Cypher focuses on the clarity of expressing *what* to retrieve from a graph, not on *how* to retrieve it.
You can think of Cypher as mapping English language sentence structure to patterns in a graph.

=== Cypher is readable

[.notes]

For example, the nouns are nodes of the graph, the verbs are the relationships in the graph, and the adjectives and adverbs are the properties.

=== Cypher style recommendations - 1

Here are the *Neo4j recommended* Cypher coding standards that we use in this training:

* Node labels are CamelCase and case-sensitive (examples: `Person`, `NetworkAddress`).
* Property keys, variables, parameters, aliases, and functions are camelCase case-sensitive (examples: `businessAddress`, `title`).
* Relationship types are in upper-case and can use the underscore. (examples: `ACTED_IN`, `FOLLOWS`).
* Cypher keywords are upper-case (examples: `MATCH`, `RETURN`).

=== Cypher style recommendations - 2

Here are the *Neo4j recommended* Cypher coding standards that we use in this training:

* String constants are in single quotes (with exceptions).
* Specify variables only when needed for use later in the Cypher statement.
* Place named nodes and relationships (that use variables) before anonymous nodes and relationships in your `MATCH` clauses when possible.
* Specify anonymous relationships with `+-->+`, `--`, or `+<--+`

== Exercise 3: Filtering queries using relationships

In Neo4j Browser:

kbd:[:play intro-neo4j-exercises]

Then follow instructions for Exercise 3.

[.slide-title.purple]
== Check your understanding

=== Question 1

[.statement]
Suppose you have a graph that contains nodes representing customers and other business entities for your application.
The node label in the database for a customer is _Customer_. Each _Customer_ node has a property named _email_ that contains the customer's email address.
What Cypher query do you execute to return the email addresses for all customers in the graph?

Select the correct answer.

[%interactive.answers]
- [ ] [src-cypher]`MATCH (n) RETURN n.Customer.email`
- [x] [src-cypher]`MATCH (c:Customer) RETURN c.email`
- [ ] [src-cypher]`MATCH (Customer) RETURN email`
- [ ] [src-cypher]`MATCH (c) RETURN Customer.email`

=== Question 2

[%interactive.statement]
Suppose you have a graph that contains _Customer_ and _Product_ nodes. A _Customer_ node can have a _BOUGHT_ relationship with a _Product_ node.
_Customer_ nodes can have other relationships with _Product_ nodes.
A _Customer_ node has a property named _customerName_.
A _Product_ node has a property named _productName_.
What Cypher query do you execute to return all of the products (by name) bought by customer 'ABCCO'.

Select the correct answer.

[%interactive.answers]
- [ ] [src-cypher]`MATCH (c:Customer {customerName: 'ABCCO'}) RETURN c.BOUGHT.productName`
- [ ] [src-cypher]`MATCH (:Customer 'ABCCO')-[:BOUGHT]->(p:Product) RETURN p.productName`
- [ ] [src-cypher]`MATCH (p:Product)<-[:BOUGHT_BY]-(:Customer 'ABCCO') RETURN p.productName`
- [x] [src-cypher]`MATCH (:Customer {customerName: 'ABCCO'})-[:BOUGHT]->(p:Product) RETURN p.productName`

=== Question 3

When [.underline]#must# you use a variable in a `MATCH` clause?

Select the correct answer.

[%interactive.answers]
- [ ] When you want to query the graph using a node label.
- [ ] When you specify a property value to match the query.
- [x] When you want to use the node or relationship to return a result.
- [ ] When the query involves 2 types of nodes.

== Summary

You can now write Cypher statements to:
[square]
* Retrieve nodes from the graph.
* Filter nodes retrieved using property values of nodes.
* Retrieve property values from nodes in the graph.
* Filter nodes retrieved using relationships.
